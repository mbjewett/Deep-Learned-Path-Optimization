This Final project scored 112% across two graders for my graduate class at UCLA, ECE C247.

Please go to dqn_main.ipynb to see the main notebook for this project. In case any of the cells that cannot be run or will take a long time to run are executed by accident, we have included a pdf of the notebook as well in the current state. We will advise only to run the "RUN THIS!" cells as the runtimes for DRL are very long. If you would like to verify the training process, we would suggest only running the first experiment since that will be the quickest. The notebook contains further instructions and guidance. We hope you enjoy the project!
